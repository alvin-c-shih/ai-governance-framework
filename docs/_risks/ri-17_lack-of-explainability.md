## Summary

AI systems, particularly those using complex foundation models, often lack transparency, making it difficult to interpret how decisions are made. This limits firms’ ability to explain outcomes to regulators, stakeholders, or customers, raising trust and compliance concerns. Without explainability, errors and biases can go undetected, increasing the risk of inappropriate use, regulatory scrutiny, and undiagnosed failures.

## Description

A key challenge in deploying AI systems—particularly those based on complex foundation models—is the difficulty of interpreting and understanding how decisions are made. These models often operate as "black boxes," producing outputs without a clear, traceable rationale. This lack of transparency in decision-making can make it challenging for firms to explain or justify AI-driven outcomes to internal stakeholders, regulators, or affected customers.

The inability to clearly articulate why a model arrived at a specific decision increases both regulatory risk and consumer distrust. In regulated industries like financial services or healthcare, explainability is often required to ensure decisions are fair, accountable, and legally defensible. When firms cannot offer such explanations, they may face scrutiny or penalties, even if the system is statistically effective.

Furthermore, a lack of explainability can conceal underlying errors or embedded biases, making it difficult to detect issues or assess the true soundness of the model. Without insight into the reasoning process, harmful decisions may go unnoticed or unchallenged until damage has already occurred. This also limits the ability to validate models using traditional testing and debugging techniques, which rely on predictable, transparent logic.

When organizations deploy AI systems without fully understanding their inner workings, they risk inappropriate or unsafe use, especially in high-stakes or automated contexts. Undiagnosed failures can persist in production, and subtle degradations in performance may go uncorrected due to the absence of meaningful diagnostic signals.
