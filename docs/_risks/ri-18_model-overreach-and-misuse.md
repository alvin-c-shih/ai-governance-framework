- The impressive capabilities of GenAI can lead to overestimation of its abilities.  
- Staff may be tempted to use AI beyond its intended scope.  
- AI trained for one task (e.g., marketing emails) might be misused for another (e.g., investment advice or legal documents).  
- Misuse of AI can result in poor-quality or non-compliant outcomes.  
- Overreliance on AI without understanding its limitations can cause operational mistakes.  
- Compliance breaches may occur if AI is used inappropriately.  
- Anthropomorphism—treating AI as a human expert—can increase the risk of misplaced trust.  
- Users may accept AI-generated recommendations too readily, leading to potential errors.
